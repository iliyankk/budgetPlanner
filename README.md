<b>User Guide</b>

To use the financial application, compile and run the code, input your monthly income, the number and amounts of your expenses, as well as your monthly savings goal, then interpret the displayed output showing your total expenses and remaining budget after savings.

This code prompts the user to input their monthly income, the number of monthly expenses, the amounts of those expenses, and their monthly savings goal. It then calculates the total expenses, subtracts them along with the savings goal from the income, and displays the remaining budget.

<b>Analysis</b>

Reflecting on the development process, I found that I didn't encounter many challenges overall, except for some difficulty in implementing certain functions within the code.

Potential improvements could include adding input validation functions to reduce code duplication, and incorporating more error handling mechanisms.

Ideas for future extensions could involve integrating a graphical user interface for a more user-friendly experience or incorporating advanced financial forecasting features to provide insights into long-term financial planning.
